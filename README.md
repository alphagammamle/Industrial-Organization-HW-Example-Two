======================================

Here you will find the files for an assignment I completed with another student for a graduate level Industrial Organization course.  The assignment replicates parts of John Rust's 1987 paper "Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of Harold Zucher" published in Econometrica Vol. 55, No. 5.
