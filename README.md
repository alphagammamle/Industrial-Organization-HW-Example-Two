Industrial-Organization-HW-Example-Two
======================================

Here you will find the files for an assignment I completed with another student for a graduate level Industrial Organization course.  The assignment replicates parts of John Rust's 1987 paper "Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of Harold Zucher" published in Econometrica Vol. 55, No. 5. The assignment and data were generated by the course professor, and course identifying information has been removed.  All HW submissions were jointly created with another student, whose name, along with all other course identifying information has been scrubbed.  The following files are included:

1. HW_4 is the original assignment file
2. IO-HW4-Ex.pdf is the main written HW submission
3. IO-HW4-Ex.tex is the LaTeX file that generated 1.
4. HO_HW4_AU.m is the main MATLAB file.
5. Likelihood.m is a supporting MATLAB function file.
6. bus_data_reshape_hw4_nolabel.csv is the data file generated and supplied by the professor


Note: All files have been altered to remove any course identifying information.
